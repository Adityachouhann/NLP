# üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository is a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects built using Python. It progresses from **basic NLP tasks** to **intermediate-level implementations**, and finally to **advanced NLP applications** using modern deep learning and transformer-based models.

## üìò What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing** is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It powers many real-world applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, chatbots, and question answering.

## üìÇ Project Categories

### üü¢ Basic NLP Projects
These projects focus on foundational tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, and basic text classification using traditional ML algorithms.


- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
  - Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
  - POS tagging and named entity recognition

- **Spam Detection**
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Naive Bayes Classifier

- **Sentiment Analysis on IMDB/Reviews**
  - Count Vectorizer + Logistic Regression
  - Binary classification (Positive/Negative)

### üü° Intermediate NLP Projects
These projects involve more complex tasks like topic modeling, multi-class classification, and sequence labeling.


- **News Category Classification**
  - Multiclass classification using SVM or Random Forest
  - Text cleaning + TF-IDF + pipeline

- **Topic Modeling with LDA**
  - Extracting topics from documents using gensim
  - Visualizations with pyLDAvis

### üî¥ Advanced NLP Projects
These leverage deep learning (LSTM, BERT, Transformers) and modern frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow/Keras.


- **Sentiment Analysis using LSTM**
  - Keras/TensorFlow-based RNN
  - Word embeddings (GloVe/Word2Vec)

- **Question Answering System**
  - Using BERT from Hugging Face
  - SQuAD-style input-output

- **Text Summarization (Abstractive)**
  - Using Transformer-based encoder-decoder models

- **Chatbot with Rasa or Transformers**
  - Intent classification + response generation
  - Optional: integrated with Streamlit or Flask

- **Fake News Detection with BERT**
  - Fine-tuned transformer on news dataset
